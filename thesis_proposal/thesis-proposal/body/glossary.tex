\newglossaryentry{in-the-wild}{
    name=in-the-wild,
    description={Refers to analyzing emotions in real-world, uncontrolled environments where factors like lighting, pose variation, and occlusions create challenges for accurate recognition. Unlike controlled lab settings, real-world scenarios involve diverse backgrounds, varying facial angles, and spontaneous expressions, making it harder for models to generalize effectively.}

\newglossaryentry{POSTER}
{
    name=POSTER,
    description={The POSTER paper, titled "A Pyramid Cross-Fusion Transformer Network for Facial Expression Recognition," introduces a novel transformer-based approach to improve Facial Expression Recognition (FER). POSTER employs a Pyramid Cross-Fusion mechanism that integrates multi-scale feature extraction. This allows the model to dynamically refine facial feature representations, ensuring that subtle muscle movements and overall facial expressions are effectively recognized.}

{
    name=intra-class,
    description={intra-class variations refer to the differences within the same facial expression category, caused by factors like individual facial structures, lighting conditions, and expression intensity.}
