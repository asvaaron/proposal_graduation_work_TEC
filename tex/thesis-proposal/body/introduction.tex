\section{Problem}

Problem context, description and summary goes in this section:

Multiple studies have explored the use of Visual Transformers and attention mechanisms for FER, particularly in challenging real-world conditions (e.g., occlusions, varying poses). For instance, there has been extensive work on hybrid Vision Transformers (ViTs) combined with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), focusing on improving feature extraction and recognition by capturing both local and global features.

However, the specific approach of modifying the MLP head architecture has not been extensively explored, making it a potentially novel contribution. Current work often focuses on the Transformer architecture itself, with enhancements like selective attention fusion. Recent investigations have not delved deeply into modifications at the classification head level.
