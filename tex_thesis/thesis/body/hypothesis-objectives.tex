%Example text:

This chapter presents the hypothesis formulated for the thesis. Also, it displays the established objectives with its corresponding deliverables. Last section gives a summary of the scope and limitations defined for this research.

\section{Hypothesis}
\label{section:hypothesis}
A brief context description of the formulation of the hypothesis can go here, followed by.
The hypothesis for this research effort reads as follows (example):

%``Our proposed method $P$ in the research can improve by $Q$\footnote{If numbers are involved, usually an explanation of why that specific number was used is given in a footnote \cite{examplereference2}.} the relation in metric 1 and metric 2\footnote{The \cite{examplereference} definition of is used.}.''

''By systematically exploring and evaluating various modifications tothe Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) head architecture of a Visual Transformer for Facial Expression
Recognition (FER), it is possible to surpass the current state-of-the-art performance achieved by the POSTER model on the RAF-DB dataset. Specifically, this study aims
to improve the accuracy from POSTERâ€™s reported 92.05\% to at least 93.00\%''

\section{Objectives}
\label{section:objectives}
The current research established the following objectives:

\subsection{Main Objective}
\label{section:main-objective}
